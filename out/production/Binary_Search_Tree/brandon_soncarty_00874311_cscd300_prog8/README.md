# Binary_Search_Tree

This is a program that I created in a Data Structures class that I took at Eastern Washington University. It is the first time I was given the chance to implement Binary Search Trees. I liked learning about them because they are an interesting and fast way to organize data and are fairly easy to comprehend.
The purpose of this program is to display a menu to the user that asks them to choose an option. An example would be "Find the successor of a given key". The program would then take the input from the keyboard and use the code associated with that menu option to find the successor to whatever the number is that the user entered.

The main method is found in the "BST.java" file. To run the program, add the "data.txt" file provided to the arguments. The program works with a large range of numbers, so feel free to edit the text file and change them.
